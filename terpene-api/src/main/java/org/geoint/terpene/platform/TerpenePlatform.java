 * A TerpenePlatform provides environmental (local/remote, IaaS, PaaS, hybrid,

 * services defined through software contracts. The platform handles many of the
 * non-functional and cross-cutting concerns for secure distributed computing,
 * allowing software components and services to focus on business requirements.
